# COEN352_first_commit
intro Github


Im Jonathan, and currently in my second year of Electrical Engineering after returning to university.

the objective of this course is to learn more about Java and programming in general.

From this assignment, I understood that Github is a platform that act like a cloud, which allows me to store my code online, share it my partner and teacher, and track changes through commits. This helps reduce issues related to file loss and compatibility
